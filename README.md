# EECS545_final_project
This repository is for 545 final project "Multi-Label Learning for Text Categorization".

# Datasets Download
All three datasets are available in the 'Datasets' folder.

# Coding Files
'data_simulation.R' is the file that generates the simulated data.
'toxic_preprocessing.py' is the file that helps do feature engineering.
All algorithms files, except for 'mlknn', whose name ends up with '_svm' is using base classifier SVM. The rest algorithms are using base classifier Logistic Regression. And 'mlknn' is by its own using base classifier modified knn.

# Main2 File
All algorithms will be called in the main2.py file, and the data is imported into this file as well.
